explanation of each task 

 

 

1. Prime Number Checker and List Generator - Python 

This Python program includes two main functions: 

is_prime: Checks if a given number is prime by testing divisibility up to the square root of the number. 

generate_primes: Generates a list of prime numbers up to a specified limit. 

The main function takes input for the limit and displays the list of prime numbers up to that limit. 

 

 

2. Student Grade Calculator - Java 

In this Java program, the functions include: 

getStudentInfo: Collects student information (name and grades). 

calculateAverage: Calculates the average of the provided scores. 

assignGrade: Assigns a letter grade (A, B, C, etc.) based on the average. 

displayResults: Displays the student’s name, average, and letter grade. 

The main function prompts the user for input, calculates the grade, and outputs the results. 

 

3. Matrix Multiplication - Python 

This Python program performs matrix multiplication with three functions: 

input_matrix: Reads a matrix from user input. 

multiply_matrices: Multiplies two matrices by calculating the dot products of rows and columns. 

display_matrix: Displays a matrix on the console. 

The main function prompts for matrix dimensions, gathers input for the matrices, and displays the result of their multiplication. 

4. Word Counter with Text Analysis - Java 

In this Java program, we analyze a given text with functions: 

countWords: Counts the total words in the text. 

countCharacters: Counts the number of characters excluding spaces. 

findLongestWord: Finds the longest word in the text. 

wordFrequency: Calculates the frequency of each word using a HashMap. 

The main function collects a text input and outputs the word count, character count, longest word, and word frequency data. 

 

 

5. Dice Roll Simulation with Statistics - Python 

This Python program simulates dice rolls with functions: 

roll_dice: Rolls a die and returns a random number between 1 and 6. 

track_rolls: Uses Python’s Counter to track each roll's outcome. 

calculate_statistics: Calculates the average roll, frequency of each outcome, and probability of each roll. 

The main function simulates multiple rolls based on user input and displays average roll results and probabilities. 

 

 

6. Flight Reservation System - Java 

This Java program simulates a basic flight reservation system: 

selectFlight: Allows selection of flights (in a simple, fixed format). 

bookSeat: Books a specified seat. 

displaySeats: Shows available and booked seats. 

cancelReservation: Cancels a booking for a specified seat. 

The main function provides a menu to display, book, or cancel seats, managing the reservation process in an array representing the seats. 

 

 

7. Multiplication Table Generator with Range - Python 

In this Python program: 

get_range: Asks the user for a start and end of the range. 

generate_table: Generates a multiplication table for a single number. 

display_tables: Iterates through the specified range and displays each multiplication table. 

The main function collects the range input, generates multiplication tables, and displays them for each number in the specified range. 

 

 

8. Currency Converter - Java 

This Java program lets the user select USD to PLN or PLN to USD conversion: 

convertCurrency: Converts the currency by multiplying the amount by the exchange rate. 

displayConversion: Outputs the conversion result based on the user’s choice and selected currency. 

The main function allows the user to select the conversion direction, enter an amount, and displays the converted result using a specified exchange rate.
